# Sinapse

Ruby EventSource service for PUB/SUB delivery.

## Goal

Sending messages from the server to a client should be as easy as sending
messages from the browser to the server. The technology is there (eg: pub/sub,
event loops, EventSource); a full featured Ruby solution wasn't. Hence Sinapse.

## Usage

This is still a work in progress. The library API shouldn't change much, yet it
may still change and break at any time.

Please see the [example](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/sinapse/tree/master/example)
for up to date working code. To try it start the Sinapse server with `bin/sinapse`
then the example rack application. Open http://localhost:3000 in different
browsers, and start a chat with yourself!

## Features

Current state: Alpha.

- Initial architecture (Goliath + EventMachine + Redis).
- EventSource (Server-Sent Events) server with support for CORS requests,
  authentication and a live updating list of channels.
- Library to manipulate user channels, authentication and to publish messages.
- Keep EventSource connection alive by sending comments are regular intervals.

Next steps towards Beta:

- retain messages with some expiry â€”to avoid missing messages because of
  network connection problems for example.
- long-polling for browsers that don't support EventSource + CORS (that
  requires messages to be retained).
